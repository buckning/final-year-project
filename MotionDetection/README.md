# Summary

The Drawing Application is a drawing program made for children. Input to the program can be performed by using a mouse or the light-brush. The user holds the light-brush and can “paint” on the screen by moving the light-brush. The Nintendo Wii Remote communicates to the computer via Bluetooth. The Wii Remote reads the infrared light from the light-brush and inputs the readings to the program. The GUI for the drawing application consists of different toolbars and a drawing area. The toolbar located at the left hand side of the GUI is where the user can select the drawing tools. Along the top of the GUI is a scrollbar used to control the size of the drawing tool. The toolbar located at the right of the GUI allows the user to specify what shape their drawing tool may be. Located at the bottom of the GUI is a colour bar which lets the user pick the colour of their drawing tool. In the centre of the GUI there is a large space for the user to create their own pictures using the drawing tools provided.
