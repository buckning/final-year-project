# Summary
The three dimensional (3D) environment is an application that demonstrates the use of face detection in an application. A face is tracked from reading a video feed from a webcam. The view  displayed  of  the  3D environment  on  the  screen  changes  depending  on  the  userâ€™s distance  from  the  screen and x-y position. This gives the impression that there is depth to the screen instead of being a flat surface. Various 3D objects are scattered through the 3D environment to add realism and provide a better perception of depth. Objects in the 3D environment may be viewed from different angles and it is possible to even look behind certain 3D objects depending on where the user is standing in relationship to the webcam.
